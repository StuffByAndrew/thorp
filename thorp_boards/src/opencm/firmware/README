To flash the firmware, you need the [OpenCM IDE v1.0.1](http://support.robotis.com/beta/ko/product/opencm/robotis_opencm.htm).
Just open, compile, and upload it as any other project.

**WARNING:** For some reason I ignore, current OpenCM IDE version 1.0.2 doesn't work! Be sure you are using the one named v1.0.1 Fixed.
