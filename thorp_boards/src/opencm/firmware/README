To flash the firmware, you need the [OpenCM IDE](http://www.robotis.com/xe/download_en/633740).
Just open, compile, and upload it as any other project. However, you will see that the original
CM9_BC.cpp/h files shipped with OpenCM-v1.0.2 don't compile. Replace by the modified versions
available in this directory and retry.
